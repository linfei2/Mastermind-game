# Mastermind-game

## Rules:

Try to guess randomly generated 4-digit code. After every try, you'll get feedback:

* "in place" for numbers situated correctly 
* "somewhere else" for numbers included in the code, but placed differently
* "none" for numbers that are not in the code

At the end of the game, the number of tries it took you to break the code will be displayed.
